The modern era is the result of the progress in Physics, and its laws are interpreted every day for more technological advancement. Physics is one of the most important subjects in Class 12. You need thorough clarity of concepts to score excellent marks in Physics. Generally, students get stressed when they come across the complexity of concepts. NCERT textbooks are prescribed for CBSE Class 12 Science exam preparation.
